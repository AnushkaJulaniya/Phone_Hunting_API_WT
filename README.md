How It Works:

Header & Search:
Displays a title and a search bar for users to find phones by name.
The Search button triggers an API request to fetch phone details.

Fetching Phone Data (API Call):
When a user enters a search query, the app calls the API to retrieve matching phones.
It then displays phone cards dynamically based on the API response.

Displaying Phone Cards:
Each phone is shown inside a div with its image, name, and a "Show Details" button.

Viewing Phone Details:
Clicking the "Show Details" button fetches additional specs from the API and displays them in a popup/modal.
The modal includes phone specifications like brand, model, release date, and featurers.

Key Technologies Used:
✅ HTML, CSS, JavaScript
✅ API Integration (fetching phone data dynamically)
✅ DOM Manipulation (displaying search results & modal popups)
